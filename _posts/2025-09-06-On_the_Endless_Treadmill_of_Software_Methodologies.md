Sometimes, I encounter developers who are eager to apply methodologies like TDD or DDD without a solid understanding of the fundamentals. This is especially common when someone joins a new team. They seem more interested in proving their skills than in understanding the team's dynamics or the project's specific context.

My point is that focusing solely on these high-level theories isn't what's most important. There are many factors to consider when working on any project.

Ultimately, the most crucial thing is to master the basics:
1.  Are names (variables, methods, classes, etc.) clear and descriptive?
2.  Does each method have a single, well-defined responsibility?
3.  Are comments added when the code isn't self-explanatory?
4.  Is the code placed in the correct layer, adhering to that layer's responsibilities?
5.  Is the code free of elements that hinder readability, like magic numbers?
6.  Are I/O-bound operations, such as database queries and external API calls, optimized?
7. ...

To be clear, I'm not suggesting that methodologies like TDD are inherently flawed. My intention is to encourage a more critical perspective. Often, these "new" approaches are simply a repackaging of timeless, fundamental principles. If you consistently adhere to the basics, you'll find you're already practicing core components of these methodologies without even naming them.

We must use these tools wisely, carefully considering our specific situation and always weighing the pros against the cons. After all, any new theory is typically marketed by highlighting its strengths.

I believe the right approach is to build new skills upon a solid foundation of the basics, always maintaining a broad and pragmatic perspective.
